## KUKA-KR5-R900-Laser-Scanner-Simulation

#### 🦾 Simulink simulation of KUKA KR5 R900 with mounted 2D laser profilometer scanning a sphere

This repository extends the basic KUKA KR5 R900 simulation by adding a **2D laser scanner** (profilometer) mounted at the robot's **TCP** (Tool Center Point). The scanner performs a **surface scan of a sphere**, simulating real-time laser profile data using **MATLAB Simulink + Simscape Multibody**.

Features:
*  Real-time simulation of KUKA KR5 R900 using Simscape Multibody  
*  2D laser scanner simulation mounted on the TCP  
*  Sphere scanning scenario with adjustable scan frequency  
*  Analytical 6DOF inverse kinematics solution  
*  Dynamic visualization of scanning motion and laser intersections  
*  Educational tool for learning about robotics, sensor integration, and scanning

### ü¶æ Simulink simulation of KUKA KR5 R900 with mounted 2D laser profilometer scanning a sphere

This repository extends the basic KUKA KR5 R900 simulation by adding a **2D laser scanner** (profilometer) mounted at the robot's **TCP** (Tool Center Point). The scanner performs a **surface scan of a sphere**, simulating real-time laser profile data using **MATLAB Simulink + Simscape Multibody**.
